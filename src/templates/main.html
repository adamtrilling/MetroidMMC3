  <h1>Metroid Randomizer</h1>
  <p>Fill in a Seed to download a randomized version of Metroid that is playable in an emulator.</p>

  <form action="/randomize" method="GET">
    <div style="width: 400px;">
      <input type="submit" value="Generate" style="float: right" />
      <div style="overflow: hidden; padding-right: .5em;">
         <input type="text" name="seed" value="{{default_seed}}" style="width: 100%;" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </form>

  <h2>Guarantees</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>The same seed will generate the same output, so that the Randomizer can be used for races</li>
      <li>The Morph Ball is in its normal location because you can't go a lot of places without it</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Caveats</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>If you die, you will lose the items that were in the vanilla Ice Beam, Wave Beam, and Long Beam locations, if you had collected
          them. This is due to the way the password system tracks (or doesn't track) those items. I'll fix this eventually but it's complicated.</li>
      <li>I haven't figured out how Ice Beam respawns work. If you collect the Wave Beam after collecting both Ice Beams, you might be
          stuck with the Wave Beam forever.</li>
      <li>I'm not sure every game is winnable. In my understanding, if you have the Morph Ball, Missiles, and do the right screen wraps,
          you should be able to get to anywhere the Ice Beams might be hiding. You can get Missiles with just the Morph Ball by defeating Kraid.</li>
      <li>This is a proof of concept. It was put together quickly in a language I don't really know. If it turns out to work and be enjoyable for
          people, I'll put a lot more time into it. But for now, expect bugs.</li>
