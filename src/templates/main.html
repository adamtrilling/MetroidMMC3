  <h1>Metroid Randomizer</h1>
  <p>Fill in a Seed to download a randomized version of Metroid that is playable in an emulator.</p>

  <form action="/randomize" method="GET">
    <div style="width: 400px;">
      <input type="submit" value="Generate" style="float: right" />
      <div style="overflow: hidden; padding-right: .5em;">
         <input type="text" name="seed" value="{{default_seed}}" style="width: 100%;" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </form>

  <h2>Guarantees</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>The same seed will generate the same output, so that the Randomizer can be used for races</li>
      <li>The Morph Ball is in its normal location because you can't go a lot of places without it</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Caveats</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>I'm not sure every game is winnable. In my understanding, if you have the Morph Ball, Missiles, and do the right screen wraps,
          you should be able to get to anywhere the Ice Beams might be hiding. You can get Missiles with just the Morph Ball by defeating Kraid.</li>
      <li>This was hacked together quickly in a language I don't really know. It's not nearly up to my normal standards of code quality.
        If it turns out to work and be enjoyable for people, I'll put a lot more time into it. But for now, expect bugs.</li>
  </ul>
